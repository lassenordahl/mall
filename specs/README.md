# Design Specifications

This directory contains authoritative design documents that guide the project's overall direction.

## Purpose

These specs represent **fully iterated design decisions** and should be treated as the source of truth for:
- Architecture patterns
- Feature requirements
- Technical decisions
- User experience goals

## For LLMs Working on This Project

When given a task, always check this directory first for relevant design docs. If there's a conflict between:
1. What's currently implemented
2. What's in IMPLEMENTATION.md (implementation log)
3. What's in `/specs` (design specs)

**The `/specs` directory wins.** Implementation should be updated to match specs.

## Current Documents

Add your design documents here. Examples:
- `PROJECT_SPEC.md` - Full technical specification
- `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` - Answered questions from spec
- `API_DESIGN.md` - API contracts and schemas
- `UX_GUIDELINES.md` - User experience requirements
- etc.
